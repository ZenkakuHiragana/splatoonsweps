# SplatoonSWEPs / weapon_model_src
This branch stores all weapon models used in the new SplatoonSWEPs.  
You can view them in Blender.  
Files starting with *c_* means they're view model,  
and starting with *w_* means they're world model.  

Basically the mesh is taken from [Splatoon Full Weapons Pack][1].
