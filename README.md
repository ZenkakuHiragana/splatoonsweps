# SplatoonSWEPs
This is a huge rework of my existing addon, [SplatoonSWEPs][1].  
You may support me on [Patreon][9].  If you do, you can see my latest progress there, which is exclusive to my patron.

The aim of this rework is the following:
* Working fine on multiplayer game (especially on dedicated servers)
* More flesh than before! (not just throwing props)
* Various options with better UI
    * Drawing crosshair
    * Left hand mode
    * Realistic scope for scoped chargers
    * DOOM-style viewmodel
    * Aim down sight
    * And so on...

# Important thing - read before testing
***
**I don't intend to let you enjoy the new SWEPs.  Actually I want you to test it to help me fix bugs.**  
**So, I think something like "The addon isn't working for me" isn't worth reading.**  
**If you're going to tell me you're in trouble, write at least the following:**  
* [ ] What happened to you? Write the detail.
* [ ] How to get the same problem? The "step to reproduce" section.
* [ ] Any errors?  If so, the message in the console.
* [ ] Your environment (OS, Graphics card, and so on).
* [ ] Addons in your game - Some of them may conflict. Please specify the one.  
**Something like "I have 300+ addons" isn't helpful, either.**
* [ ] Try removing cache files! Some updates conflict with your old cache files.  
They're located in *garrysmod/data/splatoonsweps/mapname.txt* for singleplayer and listen server host,  
and *garrysmod/download/data/splatoonsweps/mapname.txt* for multiplayer.

## Done
* A new ink system
* Inkling base system.
    You can become inkling as well.

    GUI menu is in the weapon tab and Utility -> Splatoon SWEPs.
* All main weapons in Splatoon (Wii U).

## Currently working on

    * [x] Explosive effect for bombs
    * [x] Guide marker

        * [x] Burst Bomb
        * [x] Ink Mine
        * [x] Seeker

        * [x] Suction Bomb
    * [ ] Non-explosive sub weapons
        * [ ] Disruptor
        * [ ] Point Sensor
        * [ ] Sprinkler
        * [ ] Splash Wall
        * [ ] Squid Beakon

## I want to make the following, too
* Special weapons in Splatoon and Splatoon 2
* Dualies, Brellas and some Splatoon 2 features.
* Gears and gear abilities

## How to install this project
Though this is still work in progress, you can download and test it.
If you test it in multiplayer game, all players must have the assets.
* Click **Clone or download** on the top-right, then **Download ZIP**.
* Extract the zip into garrysmod/addons/.  
  * Go to Steam -> LIBRARY -> Garry's Mod
  * Right click the game in the list or click the gear icon -> then Properties
  * Open **LOCAL FILES** tab and click **BROWSE LOCAL FILES...** button.
  * An explorer pops up. Go to **garrysmod/addons/**.
  * Put the extracted folder named **splatoonsweps-master** there.

You need the following to work it correctly.
* Team Fortress 2
* [Splatoon Full Weapons Pack][3]
* [Enhanced Inklings][4]

Playermodels are optional, but I recommend to install them, too.
* [Inkling Playermodels][5]
* [Octoling Playermodels][6]
* [Callie & Marie Playermodels][7]
* [Splatoon 2 - Octolings [PM/RAG/VOX]][8]
